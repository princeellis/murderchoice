                            <p> Murder Mystery is a fun and secretive game. You can play it with anyone, but you just need three or more players. There are three different people you could be innocent, murderer or sheriff. The innocent's job is to try to stay alive or if the sheriff dies to take his fake gun and shoot the murderer. The sheriff's job is to try to figure out who is the murderer and shoot him with his fake gun. The murderer's job is to kill everyone with his fake knife. If the sheriff dies only innocents can take the gun not the murderer. If the murderer dies while there is people left the innocents and sheriff wins, but if the innocents and sheriff die while the murderer is alive the murderer wins. Your job is to keep your identity a secret and say " Im a innocent." and try to get them to believe you. The murderer wants to kill in secret so nobody knows. This app is to choose who you are instead of using paper or someone who is not playing.</p>
